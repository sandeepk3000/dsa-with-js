# 🧠 JavaScript Array Problem Solving – Without Built-in Methods

This project contains **basic JavaScript programs** that solve common **array-related problems** using only loops and conditions. Ideal for DSA beginners and those who want to master JavaScript logic without shortcuts.

---

## 🧾 Problem List

### 1. ✅ Count Occurrences of a Number in an Array
Counts how many times a specific number appears in the array.

### 2. ✅ Find the First Index of a Number
Finds the **first index** where the number appears in the array.

### 3. ✅ Find the Last Index of a Number
Finds the **last index** where the number appears in the array.

### 4. ✅ Count Numbers Greater Than a Given Value
Counts how many elements are greater than a number `x`.

### 5. ✅ Check If the Array is Sorted
Checks if the array is sorted in **ascending order**.

### 6. ✅ Find Minimum and Maximum in Array
Finds the **smallest** and **largest** values in the array manually.

### 7. ✅ Count Pairs Whose Sum is Equal to x
Counts the number of pairs in the array that add up to `x`.

### 8. ✅ Remove Duplicates from Array
Marks all duplicate values with `-1` in the original array.

### 9. ✅ Find First and Second Largest Numbers
Finds the two largest unique numbers from the array in one pass.

### 10. ✅ Swap Two Numbers Using a Temp Variable
Swaps two numbers using a third (temporary) variable.

### 11. ✅ Swap Two Numbers Without Using Temp Variable
Swaps two numbers **without** a third variable (using arithmetic).

### 12. ✅ Rotate an Array by k Elements (Using Extra Space)
Rotates the array `k` times using an additional array.

### 13. ✅ Rotate an Array by k Elements (In-Place)
Rotates the array in-place using **reversal algorithm** (no extra space).

## 📦 Sample Output Preview

```bash
3          # Occurrences of 2
0          # Index of 1
3          # Last index of 2
5          # Numbers > 2
true       # Is sorted
9 1        # Max, Min
3          # Pairs with sum 7
[...]      # Array with duplicates marked as -1
10 9       # First and second largest
the value of a is  4
the value of b is  10
