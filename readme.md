# JavaScript Array & Number Operation Practice

This repository contains a series of JavaScript code snippets demonstrating common array and number operations using only core JavaScript (no external libraries). It is perfect for beginners who want to practice logic-building and understand how arrays and loops work.

## ðŸ§® Array and Number Operations

### 1. Count Occurrences
Counts how many times a specific number appears in an array.

### 2. Find Index of a Number
Finds the **first occurrence index** of a number in the array.

### 3. Find Last Index of a Number
Finds the **last occurrence index** of a number in the array.

### 4. Count Numbers Greater Than X
Counts how many elements are greater than a given number `x`.

### 5. Check if an Array is Sorted
Checks whether the array is sorted in increasing order.

### 6. Find Minimum and Maximum in an Array
Finds the smallest and largest numbers in the array.

### 7. Count Pairs with Sum Equal to X
Counts the number of unique pairs whose sum equals `x`.

### 8. Remove Duplicates from an Array
Removes duplicate elements by marking them with `-1`.

### 9. First and Second Largest Number
Finds the two largest distinct numbers in the array.

### 10. Swap Two Numbers
Swaps two numbers using a temporary variable.

### 11. Swap Without Using Third Variable
Swaps two numbers using arithmetic operations.

### 12. Rotate Array by K Elements (With Extra Space)
Rotates the array to the right by `k` elements using an extra array.

### 13. Rotate Array by K Elements (Without Extra Space)
Rotates the array in place using **array reversal technique**.

## ðŸš€ Advanced Array Tasks

### 14. Move All Zeros to End (With Extra Space)
Moves all zeros to the end of the array using an auxiliary array.

### 15. Move All Zeros to End (In-Place)
Moves all zeros to the end of the array without using extra space.

### 16. Frequency Array
Creates a frequency array to count how many times each number appears (useful for fast lookups).

### 17. Search Using Frequency Array
Search for a numberâ€™s occurrence count using the precomputed frequency array.

### 18. Move All Odd Numbers to Beginning
Rearranges the array so that all odd numbers come before even numbers.

### 19. Sort Squares of a Sorted Array
Given a sorted array (possibly containing negative numbers), returns a sorted array of the squares of each number.

## ðŸ“‚ Notes

- All operations are implemented using basic loops and conditionals.
- Some tasks (like rotate without extra space or sorting squares) use **two-pointer** or **reversal** techniques.
- This is great practice for **DSA interviews**, **logic building**, and **JavaScript foundations**.

## ðŸ§  To-Do (Optional Enhancements)

- Optimize some operations using `Set` or `Map`
- Add user input interface (e.g. `prompt()`)
- Add test cases for each function
- Add ES6 syntax alternatives
